Description:
This is starting out as a link shortener app (similar to bit.ly), and based off of a Nettuts+ project (http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ruby/how-to-build-a-shortlink-app-with-ruby-and-redis/)
It will eventually become a link list builder. That is, it will take a list of url links, store them in a redis database, and generate a shortened link that will render the list.

I intend for this app to be used with other apps in mind (primarily Twitter), where the number of characters can severely limit how many links can be posted at once.
This app will let a Twitter user build a shortened link that points to several links (think of a top-10 list for plants or your 5 favorite recipes).

23-July-2011: Initial commit. Basic shortlink generation ability. Nothing special.
